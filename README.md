## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. 
This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

By this assignment we would like to understand:
1.Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2.How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
Conclusion can be found in the notebook in this repository.


## Technologies Used
